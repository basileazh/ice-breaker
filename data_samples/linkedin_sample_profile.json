      "description": "LAGR was a DARPA competition in autonomous vision-based off-road robot navigation. Nine labs competed in many races through complex off-road terrain over the course of 3 years. In the first year, our team achieved the competition's 3-year goal of improving the baseline run-time by a factor of 2, forcing the government to up the goal to a factor of 3. \n\nUsing visual input for navigation is essential in unstructured outdoor environments, which can cause simpler sensors such as GPS, odometry, and laser scanners to drift severely or become unusably noisy. As an alternative to such sensors, I contributed a novel, fast form of visual odometry. Our efficient âhybrid visual odometryâ method used 5% of the CPU time, in contrast to full VO methods which require an entire CPU. Despite this, it maintained comparable accuracy to full VO over diverse terrain types. This makes it particularly suitable for consumer robots, extraterrestrial rovers, and other platforms with limited computing power. \n\nThis contribution was described in the ICRA 2009 paper Efficient Off-Road Localization Using Visually Corrected Odometry, and contributed to our JFR 2009 paper, A Multi-Range Architecture for Collision-Free Off-Road Robot Navigation.",
